\section*{Problem 1}

In this problem we are presented with a Hough transform problem, wherein $x$, $y$, $b$, and $m$ are positive or negative real numbers. 2 points are given in $(m,b)$ space by $P_1: (m,b)=(0.5,4)$ and $P_2: (m,b)=(0.9,0)$.

\subsection*{A}

What line $L_1$ in $(m,b)$ space through $P_1$ and $P_2$?

We can set the line equation ($y=mx+b$) for $P_1$ and $P_2$ equal to eachother to solve this.

\begin{equation}
    P_1 = P_2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    0.5x+4 = 0.9x + 0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    4 = 0.4x
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    10 = x
\end{equation}

\noindent ...and then we plug in $x$ to solve for $y$:

\begin{equation}
    0.5(10)+4 = y
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    y = 9
\end{equation}

\noindent ...thus the equation for $L_1$, a line that passes through points $P_1$ and $P_2$, is $b = -10m + 9$.

\subsection*{B}

The point $P_3$ in $(x,y)$ space that corresponds to line $L_1$ is the point $(10,9)$, as calculated above in part $A$. We can also just deduce it from our solved equation mentioned in $A$ - specifically that since $y=mx+b$ for $b=-mx+y$, and we stated that $b=-10m+9$, we can also deduce that $(x,y)=(10,9)$.

\subsection*{C}

Since it is a horizontal line, which means the slope $m$ must be $m=0$, we now know that the resulting point, $P_4$, must fall along the line we calculated earlier, $L_1$, specifically where $m=0$, or the vertical axis of $(m,b)$ space. Thus we can solve:

\begin{equation}
    b = -10m + 9
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    b = -10*0 + 9
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    b = 9
\end{equation}

\noindent ...thus we know that $P_4$ will fall on $(m,b)=(0,9)$. This means that the equation for $L_2$ is $y=9$.

\section*{Problem 2}

\section*{Problem 3}

In this problem we are solving equations having to do with image focus and lenses.

\subsection*{A}

We aim to prove that for a thin lens, the image is in focus when:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{-z_O} + \frac{1}{z_c} = \frac{1}{f}
\end{equation}
